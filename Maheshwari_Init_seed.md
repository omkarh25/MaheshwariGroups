We are trying to build a showcase website for an established Industrial Supplier called "Maheshwari Groups".
Theier original business has been "Maheshwari Industrial Supplies" since 1980 and they ventured into the "Maheshwari Power Control" in 2009. Their latest venture is "Power Star Technologies" in 2019.

First lets build a landing page for MIS.
